    </div>
        <p>And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
            Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.  - Matthew 14:28-33 (KJV)</p>

            <ol class="color-white">
                <li>Look for Jesus and keep looking to Jesus. Although a storm surrounded Him, Peter looked to Jesus. The only problem was that he stopped looking at Jesus. The principle is clear: especially when life is a tumultuous storm, look for Jesus and keep looking to Jesus. What does looking to Jesus look like for you?</li>
                <li>When Jesus commands you, obey Him. Jesus told Peter to “come” to Him on the water. Even though it made no sense, Peter did what Jesus said. This is what obedience looks like–doing what Jesus says. Is there any area where you are not obeying the Lord?</li>
                <li>Faith is simply taking the next step. Peter took one step to get out of the boat and onto the water. Peter was doing just fine when he was focused on the next step and got into trouble when he lost sight of his next step. What next step has Jesus asked you to take?</li>
                <li>Faith unleashes the supernatural. Peter did not experience the supernatural power of God that allowed him to walk on water until he trusted, as evidenced by his actions. Is there anything you need to be doing differently in faith?</li>
                <li>Fear will sink you. When Peter had faith, he walked on water. When he had fear, he sank into the water. The same is true for you. Fear will sink you. Is there any fear that is gripping and controlling your decision-making?</li>
                <li>Jesus saves you from many things. Jesus not only saved Peter from hell, but on this occasion, Jesus saved Peter from drowning. What things has Jesus saved you from?</li>
                <li>A little faith is better than no faith. The Lord Jesus spoke of Peter’s “little faith.” This means that he was capable of even greater sustained confidence. </li>
                <li>You can choose to worry or worship. In an instant, the men went from worrying about their circumstances to worshipping their Christ. How is your worship of the Lord going?</li>
